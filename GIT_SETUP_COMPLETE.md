## 🚀 Next Steps: Push to GitHub

### Option 1: Create New GitHub Repository (Recommended)

**Step 1: Create repo on GitHub**
1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `ankurs-wiki-notes` or `chrome-wiki-notes`
3. Description: "Minimalist Chrome extension for wiki-style notes and 5-color highlighting"
4. Keep it **Public** (or Private if you prefer)
5. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
6. Click "Create repository"

**Step 2: Connect and push**
```bash
cd /Users/ankbnsl/workspace/claudeworkspace/chromePluginToWriteNotes

# Add GitHub as remote origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/REPO_NAME.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

**Example:**
```bash
# Replace 'ankbnsl' with your GitHub username and 'chrome-wiki-notes' with your repo name
git remote add origin https://github.com/ankbnsl/chrome-wiki-notes.git
git push -u origin main
```

### Option 2: Use GitHub CLI (if installed)

```bash
cd /Users/ankbnsl/workspace/claudeworkspace/chromePluginToWriteNotes

# Create repo and push in one command
gh repo create chrome-wiki-notes --public --source=. --push

# Or for private repo
gh repo create chrome-wiki-notes --private --source=. --push
```
